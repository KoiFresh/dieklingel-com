## Hardware

As far as good, now I know the software, but what hardware do i have or be able to use ?

For the right hardware check out our blog articels. There you will find one or more articles about hardware and the design of the dooruni, which we or other people use. If you build a doorunit, with some (special) hardware or some other cool stuff, we woul be happy if you sumbit a pull request to this repo (<https://github.com/KoiFresh/dieklingel-homepage>) with  a blog article describingt your build. Not only to document what you did :), but also to inspire others. A good starting point will be [doorunit-design-v2](blog/doorunit-design-v2).
