## 💸 Where to buy the product

At the moment we don't sell dieKlingel as product at it is not planned, becuase you could easily buy every part by yourself and asseble it. If you need any 3d printed parts you can refere to an online 3d printing service or write us an email an we will find a solution. If you still want to buy dieKlingel as a all-in-one product, let us know, so we can consider this in the future.
